	[ ]  Read all the fractions stored in the **data.txt** file into a vector of fractions

	[ ]  Print out all the fractions read from the file using the minimum presentation, separated by comma ( "," )
    	[ ]  First priority, full number. For example, **4/2** should be printed out **2**
    	[ ]  Second priority, mixed fraction. For example, **9/2** should be printed out **4 1/2**
    	[ ]  Third priority, lowest term. For example, **2/4** should be printed out **1/2**
    	[ ]  The last priority, keep it as it is (No greatest common divisor between numerator and denominator)
	[ ]  Generate randomly 2 more fractions with numerator and denominator in the range of [1, 99] and add them to the list

	[ ]  Adding new ability to check for validity of the fraction before constructing back the fraction list.

	[ ]  Overwrite the original data.txt, adding the two new fractions into this file
